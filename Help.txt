when you start the main.py it will ask for a password its is by default 1234 but you can change it in the code

if you make any apps for the os you can put them in the apps folder

you have to do load.v1.0 to load the commands

the commands are 

rom/
rom/exe
rom/create
file.print
file.edit
exit()

any app you put in the apps folder can pe a .py .js .css or .html (HTML doesent work right)
